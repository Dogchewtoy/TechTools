Use the steps below to perform an embedded packet capture on a Cisco Router


Cisco IOS-based Routers (12.4(20)T or later)

! Config mode (router(config)#)
1. Create an access list used to filter packets captured (highly recommended if you know what you're looking for)

 ip access-list ext packet-cap-filter
  permit ip host 10.131.2.40 host 10.26.25.247
  permit ip host 10.26.25.247 host 10.131.2.40

  
! This command and all subsequent commands performed from privileged exec mode (router#)
2.  Create a local packet capture buffer
 
 monitor capture buffer packet-cap size 2048 max-size 4096 circular (can be linear to stop when buffer max reached)

3.  Associate packet capture buffer with access list filter

 monitor capture buffer packet-cap filter access-list packet-cap-filter
 
4.  Create a packet capture point - this is the operation that buffers captured packets

 monitor capture point ip cef cap-in gi0/0 both  <---- you can select the interface to perform the packet capture and the direction (in/out/both).  Additionally, you can capture process-switched packets (in/out/from-us) to look for traffic punted to the CPU

5.  Associate the capture point with the capture buffer

 monitor capture point associate cap-in packet-cap

 6.  Start the packet capture
 
 monitor capture point start cap-in <---- use monitor capture point stop cap-in to stop the capture
 
 7.  Operation
 
 monitor capture buffer packet-cap clear <---- Clears contents of packet capture buffer

 monitor capture buffer packet-cap export tftp://10.131.2.40/packet.pcap <---- Export packet capture for analysis, can be Flash, TFTP, FTP, HTTP, etc.

Show Commands

show monitor capture buffer all parameters <---- Display the parameters associated with the Capture activities, good for cleanup

show monitor capture point all <---- Display capture point and status

show monitor capture buffer packet-cap <---- Display contents of packet capture buffer






Cisco IOS-XE based Routers

  
! This command and all subsequent commands performed from privileged exec mode (router#)
2.  Create a packet capture point - this is the operation that buffers captured packets

 monitor capture cap-in interface gi0/0/1 both <---- you can select the interface to perform the packet capture and the direction (in/out/both).  Additionally, you can capture process-switched (control-plane) packets (in/out/from-us) to look for traffic punted to the CPU

5.  Associate the capture point with the filter

monitor capture cap-in match ipv4 host 10.131.2.40 host 10.26.25.247 buffer circular size 2  <---- Other options available

 6.  Start the packet capture
 
 monitor capture cap-in start <---- use monitor capture point cap-in stop  to stop the capture
 
 7.  Operation
 
 monitor capture cap-in  clear <---- Clears contents of packet capture buffer

 monitor capture cap-in export tftp://10.131.2.40/packet.pcap <---- Export packet capture for analysis, can be Flash, TFTP, FTP, HTTP, etc.
 
 no monitor capture cap-in <---- Remove capture-related commands

Show Commands

show monitor capture cap-in brief  <---- Display capture point summary

show monitor capture cap-in detailed <---- Display capture point contents

show monitor capture buffer packet-cap <---- Display contents of packet capture buffer
